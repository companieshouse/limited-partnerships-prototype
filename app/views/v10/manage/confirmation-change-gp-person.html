<p class="govuk-body">We've received the updated details for Georgina Smith, who is a general partner of ACME LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (SL012345). <p> We've sent a confirmation email to <strong>{{ data['govOneLoginEmail'] or "agent@authorised-agent.com" }}</strong>.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

<p>We'll process this filing within 5 working days, and email <strong>{{ data['govOneLoginEmail'] or "agent@authorised-agent.com" }}</strong> to let you know if it's been accepted or rejected.

  {{ govukInsetText({
    text: "This update will not show in this service, or on the public register, until we accept the filing."
  }) }}

  <p> If it's accepted, the filing will appear in the limited partnership's filing history on the public register.
    
  <p> If it's rejected, we'll explain why and tell you what to do next.
