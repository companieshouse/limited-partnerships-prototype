          </strong>
        </div>

<p>Before filing a confirmation statement, you should check the limited partnership information we hold and update any information that's incorrect.<p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Updating limited partnership information</h2>

<p>To view the information we hold, search for the limited partnership on the <a href="../chs/start">Companies House register</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to update any information, select the 'File for this company' button on the limited partnership overview page. You'll need to sign in to your Companies House account</a>.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can file for a limited partnership</h2>
<p>Only Authorised Corporate Service Providers (ACSPs) can file for a limited partnership. This includes updating information and submitting a confirmation statement. ACSPs are also known as Companies House authorised agents.</p>

<p>Authorised agents are businesses that are registered with a UK Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body. For example, accountants or solicitors. They must <a href="JAVASCRIPT:VOID(0)">register as an authorised agent with Companies House</a> to be able to file on behalf of clients.</p>



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
<p>To file a confirmation statement, you'll need</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

            <li>the limited partnership number </li>
           </ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Fee</h3>

<p>There is an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/confirmation-statement-guidance#annual-fee">annual fee</a> of Â£X to file a confirmation statement.</p>
