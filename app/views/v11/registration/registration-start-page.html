    <p>This service has replaced the paper forms LP5, LP5(s), LP7 and LP7(s).</p>

      
      
      
    <h2 id="content-1" class="govuk-heading-l">Who can use this service</h2>

          <p>To register a limited partnership, you must be an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP). ACSPs are also known as Companies House authorised agents.</p>
    
          <p>Authorised agents are businesses like accountants, solicitors or company formation agents, that have registered with Companies House to be able to file on behalf of clients. <a href="#/">Find out more about registering as an authorised agent</a>.</p>

          <p>If you are someone else involved with the limited partnership, you'll need to find an authorised agent to file on your behalf.</p>
 

    <h2 id="content-2" class="govuk-heading-l">Types of partnership you can register</h2>
      
          <p>You can register a limited partnership (LP) or private fund limited partnership (PFLP) in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, or Scotland.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Limited partnerships in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</h3>
                <p>You can register a limited partnership in the jurisdiction of England and Wales, or Northern Ireland. 

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Scottish limited partnerships</h3>

                <p>Limited partnerships registered in Scotland also have to provide information about their people with significant control (PSCs).

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Private fund limited partnerships (PFLPs)</h3>

                <p>You can choose to register a Private Fund Limited Partnership (PFLP) under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/514/contents/made" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">the Legislative Reform (Private Fund Limited Partnerships) Order 2017</a>. A PFLP’s structure differs from the ordinary limited partnership structure.
                
                <p>To register as a private fund limited partnership, the partnership must meet the private fund conditions. This means that the partnership is formed by an agreement in writing and is a collective investment scheme.
  

    
    <h2 id="content-3" class="govuk-heading-l">What information we'll ask for</h2>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Information about the partnership</h3>

                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Name of the partnership</h4>
                  
                  <p>The partnership name needs to meet set rules. For example, it cannot be the same as another registered partnership or company, or include certain words or phrases.</p>

                  <p> To find out more about the rules the limited partnership’s name needs to meet, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/set-up-and-run-a-limited-partnership#choose-a-name">read the guidance on choosing a name</a>.</p>

                  <p> You must check that the name meets the rules before you register the partnership. If it does not, we may reject your application, or you may need to change it later. </p>

                  <p>You’ll also need to select a name ending to go on the public record. There is no difference between the name endings except how they look. You can choose Limited Partnership, L.P. or LP. If the partnership is in Wales, you also have the option of a Welsh name ending: Partneriaeth Cyfyngedig, P.C. or PC.</p>

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">2.	Registered email address</h4>

                  <p>We’ll use this email address to send important information that relates to the partnership. For example, new legislative requirements or warnings about missed deadlines.</p>

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">3.	Jurisdiction</h4>

                  <p>This is where the partnership was formed: England and Wales, Northern Ireland, or Scotland.</p>

                  <p>The registered office address must be in this jurisdiction. The principal place of business must be in the jurisdiction at registration.</p>

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"> 4.	Registered office address </h4>

                  <p>We’ll use this address to send official communications. It must be a physical address in the UK. You cannot use a PO Box address.

                  <p>The address must be ‘appropriate’. This means that:
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>it is in the jurisdiction where the limited partnership is registered (England and Wales, Northern Ireland, or Scotland)</li>
                      <li>someone acting on behalf of the limited partnership will be made aware of any post addressed and delivered to the limited partnership</li>
                      <li>when the limited partnership receives post at this address, it’s possible for the sender to get confirmation of delivery</li>                     
                    </ul>

                                      <div class="govuk-warning-text">
                    <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
                    <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
                      <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">Warning</span>
                      The partnership could be struck off the Companies House register if you do not provide a registered office address that meets all of these requirements.
                    </strong>
                  </div>

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">5.	Principal place of business </h4>

                  <p>This is the address where the day to day running of the business takes place. It could be the same as the registered office address, or a different address.
                  
                  <p>It must be in the jurisdiction where the partnership was formed. It can be changed to an address outside of the jurisdiction after you’ve registered the partnership.

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">6.	Term of the partnership </h4>

                  <p>You’ll need to select the term of the partnership from these options:
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>such term as decided by the partners within the partnership agreement</li>
                      <li>until the general partner determines the partnership is dissolved</li>
                      <li>no set term</li>
                    </ul>

                  <p>Private fund limited partnerships do not need to provide information about the term of the partnership.

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">7. Nature of business</h4>

                  <p>You'll need to tell us about the intended nature of the partnership's business activities.
                    
                    <p><a href="https://resources.companieshouse.gov.uk/sic/">Use our look up tool to find the most relevant category or categories of business activities</a>. Each category has a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code.

                  <p>Private fund limited partnerships do not need to provide information about the nature of business.

                  <p>For any other partnership, you must enter at least one SIC code. You can enter a maximum of 4.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Information about general partners</h3>  

              <p> The partnership must have at least one general partner at registration.</p>

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">General partners who are people</h4>
              
                  <p>For each general partner who is an individual person, you’ll need to provide their:

                  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                  <p>You’ll need to confirm that they are not disqualified under the directors disqualification legislation, as defined in the Limited Partnership Act 1907.</p>


              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">General partners that are legal entities</h4>

                  <p>For each general partner that is a legal entity, you’ll need to provide:

                      <li>its name</li>

                  <p>By providing the entity’s information, you will be confirming that the entity has legal personality.
            
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Information about limited partners</h3>

                  <p>The partnership must have at least one limited partner at registration.

                  <p>You must tell us about each limited partner’s capital contribution, unless you are registering a private fund limited partnership (where this information is not required).

                  <p>We'll ask for:
                  
                  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>the total value of all monetary and non-monetary contributions – this should be provided as a single amount</li>

                    </ul>

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Limited partners who are people</h4>
              
                  <p>For each limited partner who is an individual person, you’ll need to provide their:

                    </ul>

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Limited partners that are legal entities</h4>

                  <p>For each limited partner that is a legal entity, you’ll need to provide:

                  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>its name</li>

                    </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Information about people with significant control (PSCs)</h3>

              <p>This only applies to Scottish partnerships.
              
              <p>For Scottish limited partnerships, and Scottish private fund limited partnerships, you must tell us about any people with significant control (PSCs). These could be:

              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>individual people</li>
                      <li>relevant legal entities (RLEs)</li>
                      <li>other registrable persons (ORPs)</li>
                    </ul>

              <p>If the partnership has no PSCs, you’ll need to state this.
              
              <p>You’ll need to provide information about each PSC, even if it is a person or entity you have provided information about elsewhere.

              <p>You’ll also need to give information about each PSC’s nature of control. We’ll ask you to select all that apply, from these options:

              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>nature of control for the PSC</li>

                    </ul>
              
              <p>You’ll then need to give us further information about whether the nature of control relates to share of assets, ownership of voting rights, ownership of right to appoint/remove management, or other significant influence or control.

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">PSCs who are people</h4>

                <p>For each PSC who is a person, you’ll need to provide their:
