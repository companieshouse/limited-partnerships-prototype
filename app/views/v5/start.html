<button class="govuk-link govuk-body-s gem-c-print-link__button" data-module="print-link" data-print-link-module-started="true">Print this page</button>

<p class="govuk-body">You can set up a limited partnership to run your business.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You must have at least one ‘general partner’ and one ‘limited partner’. General and limited partners have different responsibilities and levels of liability for any debts the business cannot pay. All partners pay tax on their share of the profits.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You'll need to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>choose a name</li>
  <li>have a registered address (also known as your principal place of business)</li>
  <li>appoint general and limited partners</li>
  <li>register with Companies House</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">The rules are different for setting up a <a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">limited liability partnership</a>, an <a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">'ordinary' business partnership</a> or a <a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">private limited company</a>. </p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="choose-a-name">Choose a name</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">You can trade under your own names, or you can choose another name for your business. You do not need to register your name.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You must include all the partners’ names and the business name (if you have one) on official paperwork, for example invoices and letters.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="business-name">Business names</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Limited partnership names must not:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>include ‘limited liability partnership’, ‘LLP’, ‘public limited company’ or ‘plc’</li>
  <li>be offensive</li>
  <li>be the same as an <a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">existing trade mark</a></li>
  <li>register with Companies House</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Your name also cannot contain a ‘sensitive’ word or expression, or suggest a connection with government or local authorities, unless you get permission.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Example</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">To use ‘Accredited’ in your company’s name, you need permission from the Department for Business and Trade (DBT).</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Check which <a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">words you need permission to use, and who from</a>.</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  You'll need to <a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">register your name as a trade mark</a> if you want to stop people from trading under your business name
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="registered-address">Registered address</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Your registered address (known as principal place of business) is where official communications are sent, for example letters from HMRC.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It must be:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a physical address</li>
  <li>your main place of business</li>
  <li>in the same country that your limited partnership is registered in (for example, a limited partnership registered in Scotland must have a registered office address in Scotland) — once you’re incorporated you can move anywhere in UK</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">You can use your home address — this will be publicly available.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="partners-responsibilities">Partner's responsibilities</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">You must have at least one ‘general partner’ and one ‘limited partner’ — a partner can be an individual or a company.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">What type of partner you are makes a difference to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>your liability for the partnership’s debts</li>
  <li>your responsibilities</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You cannot be a general and a limited partner at the same time.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">All partners are equally responsible for any debts or obligations until the partnership has been registered.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Limited partners</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">As a limited partner you:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>contribute an amount of money or property to the business when it’s set up</li>
  <li>are only liable for debts up to the amount you’ve contributed</li>
  <li>cannot manage the business</li>
  <li>cannot remove your original contribution
</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You must <a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">register for Self Assessment with HMRC</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">General partners</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">As a general partner you:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>are liable for any debts the business cannot pay</li>
  <li>control and manage the business</li>
  <li>can make irreversible (‘binding’) decisions for the business</li>
  <li>can apply for your business to act as an authorised contractual scheme (ACS)
</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">you must:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>register the business with Companies House</li>
  <li><a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">register the business for Self Assessment</a> with HMRC - you must also <a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)"> register separately as an individual </a></li>
  <li><a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">register the business for VAT</a> if you expect sales to be more than £90,000 a year</li>
  <li>act for the business if it’s wound up and dissolved

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="authorised-partnership">Becoming an authorised partnership</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">In an ACS money or property (‘assets’) are pooled and managed on behalf of the partners. Partners co-own the assets but only pay tax on their share of any profits — the scheme does not pay <a class"govuk-link" href="javascript:void(0)">Corporation Tax </a>.</p>
